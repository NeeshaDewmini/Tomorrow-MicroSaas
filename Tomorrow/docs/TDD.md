ðŸ“„ Technical Design Document (TDD)

1. Introduction
   
The UniTime project is a Micro SaaS web application that aims to help university students schedule their academic calendar, tasks, and personal goals.
This document describes the technical design and architecture overview of the UniTime system, including major technology decisions, data model, API flows, 
and security.

2. System Overview
   
Tomorrow is a web application which allows users to:

Manage their tasks with due dates and priorities
See tasks on a dynamic calendar
Monitor task statistics (completed, imcomplete, overdue)
Modify their profile and preferences
Sync all the data in real-time with Firebase backend services

4. Technology Stack

Component: Frontend		
Technology Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Reason: Simple, lightweight

Component: Backend (Serverless)	
Technology Used: Firebase Authentication + Firestore	
Reason: Real-time data sync, easy auth

Component: Database	
Technology Used: Firebase Firestore	
Reason: NoSQL, scalable, easy to use

Component: Version Control		
Technology Used: Git + GitHub
Reason: Team collaboration, CI/CD



5. Database Design

   
Firestore Structure:

users (Collection)
  â””â”€â”€ userId (Document)
        â”œâ”€â”€ name: "Neesha"
        â”œâ”€â”€ email: "neesha@example.com"
        â”œâ”€â”€ notifications: "on"
        â”œâ”€â”€ theme: "light"
        â””â”€â”€ tasks (Subcollection)
              â”œâ”€â”€ taskId1 (Document)
                    â”œâ”€â”€ name: "Finish Assignment"
                    â”œâ”€â”€ priority: "High"
                    â”œâ”€â”€ dueDate: "2025-04-30"
                    â”œâ”€â”€ completed: false
                    â”œâ”€â”€ favorited: true
              â”œâ”€â”€ taskId2 (Document)
                    â””â”€â”€ ...

                    
6. APIs and Data Flow


Action: User Sign Up
API / Functionality: Login	firebase.auth().createUserWithEmailAndPassword() / signInWithEmailAndPassword()

Action: Fetch User Profile	
API / Functionality: db.collection("users").doc(userId).get()

Action: Update User Profile	
API / Functionality: db.collection("users").doc(userId).update({ name, email, theme, notifications })

Action: Create Task	
API / Functionality: db.collection("users").doc(userId).collection("tasks").add(taskData)

Action: Edit Task	
API / Functionality: db.collection("users").doc(userId).collection("tasks").doc(taskId).update(updatedData)

Action: Delete Task	
API / Functionality: db.collection("users").doc(userId).collection("tasks").doc(taskId).delete()

Action: Real-time Task Sync	
API / Functionality: .onSnapshot() listener on tasks subcollection



7. Security Considerations
   
Authentication:
Only authenticated users can access the UniTime app.

Firestore Rules:


rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == userId;

      match /tasks/{taskId} {
        allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == userId;
      }
    }
  }
}

Validation:

Frontend validates inputs before sending to Firestore.
Prevents empty task names or invalid dates.

8. Key Technical Decisions

Decision: Use Firebase for backend	
Reason : Reduces complexity, serverless, real-time sync

Decision: Firestore instead of Realtime Database	
Reason : More scalable, structured querying

Decision: Separate tasks as subcollections	
Reason : Keeps data modular and user-specific
 
Decision: Simple Frontend (HTML, CSS, JS)	
Reason : Faster development, no framework overhead



9. Limitations and Future Improvements

Limitation: No offline support , No advanced task sharing
Future Improvement: I,mplement Firestore offline persistence, Add group task features
