Date: April 26, 2025 
Version: 1.0

Tomorrow is a Firebase-hosted, light-weight time management app for students and professionals to monitor tasks, set deadlines, and stay productive. 
Being a course project from System Administration & Maintenance, the app is designed to exemplify best practices
in scalable frontend development, cloud integration, and DevOps procedures.
 
Problem Statement:
 
 In an era of distractions, effective time management is a struggle. Current software such as
 Trello and Notion are mighty but usually too complicated for customers who simply want a
 quick, simple task manager. There's a demand for a light application that focuses on usability
 and quickness.
 
Goals and Objectives:
 
 Enable users to add, edit, delete, and prioritize tasks.
 Store tasks on the cloud using Firebase Firestore.
 Offer login/logout capabilities using Firebase Authentication.
 Sync data in real-time across devices.
 Show enterprise-level CI/CD and DevOps processes.

Target Users:

 Students at universities balancing deadlines and assignments.
 Multiple projects are managed by freelancers.
 A basic task board is necessary for remote workers.
